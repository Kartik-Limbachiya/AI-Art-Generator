# AI-Art-Generator

## Overview
#### Simple Art style transferer.
#### You give a style image and the model learns the features and transfers it to the content image.
#### Best recommended to run with a GPU for fastest result

## How it works?
#### Neural style transfer is an optimization technique used to take two images, style reference image (such as an artwork by a famous painter), and the input image you want to style.

#### The model then blends the images to give your input image a artistic style.
